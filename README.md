My various setup/installer scripts for Alpine Linux
===================================================

I use these scripts for my own setups. You can use them too, but I encourage you
to examine the scripts to actually understand what's going on. Some of the
scripts here are compatible with other distributions (e.g. Arch), but it's been
developed for Alpine.

Some points of interest:
- [Run Alpine Linux in _diskless_ mode, booted
from a persistent USB stick containing packages and configurations, while also
mounting encrypted BTRFS disks and ZFS pools](diskless_alpine_on_persistent_usb_with_encrypted_btrfs_zfs.md)
- [Install Alpine Linux on Raspberry Pi 5][install_alpine_on_raspberry_pi_5_sd_card.sh]
- [Run Alpine Linux as a tmux kiosk][setup_tmux_kiosk.md]
